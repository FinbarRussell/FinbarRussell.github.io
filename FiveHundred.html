                    <h1>Game Rules</h1>
                    <p><strong>500</strong> is a trick-taking game similar to Whist.</p>
                    <h2>Betting</h2>
                    <p>Each round, a player places a bet. This <strong>determines</strong> which suit will become trumps and also sets the number of tricks a team must win in order to gain the relevant points, up to a maximum of 500 for all 10 tricks won with no trumps.</p>
                    <p>Clubs are worth 60, Spades 70, Diamonds 80, Hearts 90, and No Trumps 100. For each number of tricks over 6, 100+ is added to the bet.</p>
                    <p>If, after 10 tricks, a team does not achieve their bet number of tricks, the points are deducted from their score instead of being added.</p>
                    <p>The team that did not win the bet will have 10+ points added for each trick they won, up to a maximum of 10.</p>
                    <p>Upon reaching 500, a team wins. If a team reaches -500, they lose.</p>
                    <h2>Trumps</h2>
                    <p>Once a bet has been made, the suit called becomes trumps. If no trumps are selected, then no suit will be trumps.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Joker</strong> card is considered a trump card and is the highest card in 500.</p>
                    <h3>Bowers</h3>
                    <p>Jacks have a special role in 500. The Jack of the trump suit becomes the <strong>right bower</strong> and ranks second highest, below the Joker.</p>
                    <p>The Jack with the same colour but different suit to trumps becomes the <strong>left bower</strong>. For example, when Hearts are trumps, the Jack of Diamonds becomes the left bower.</p>
                    <p>The left bower is the third highest-ranking card.</p>
                    <p>All other cards are ranked as usual: number cards are beaten by the Queen, which is beaten by the King, which is beaten by the Ace.</p>
                    <h2>Tricks</h2>
                    <p>The winner of a trick is the player who plays the highest card.</p>
                    <p>The player must follow the first suit played if possible. If they do not have this suit, they may play any card.</p>
                    <p>If a card is played off-suit, i.e., Spades are played but the player has no Spades and plays a Club, then they cannot win unless it is a trump card.</p>
                    <p>If a trump is played off-suit, then it will automatically win unless another trump that is higher is played.</p>
                    <p>In No Trumps, the Joker is the only card that can be played off-suit and still win.</p>
