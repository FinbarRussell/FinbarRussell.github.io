                    <h1>Rules of 500</h1>

                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>The objective of the game is to be the first team to reach <span class="highlight">500 points</span> by winning tricks and bidding successfully.</p>
                
                    <h2>Players</h2>
                    <p>500 is played by <span class="highlight">four players</span> in partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other.</p>
                
                    <h2>The Deck</h2>
                    <p>A standard deck of <span class="highlight">43 cards</span> is used, which includes a Joker and exludes 2's,3's, and black 4's.</p>
                
                    <h2>Dealing</h2>
                    <p>Each player is dealt <span class="highlight">10 cards</span>. The remaining three cards form the kitty, which is set aside for the winning bidder.(not included yet)</p>
                
                    <h2>Bidding</h2>
                    <p>
                        Players bid for the number of tricks they believe their team can win, starting at a minimum of <span class="highlight">six</span>. The bids range from six to ten, with a specified trump suit, or a No Trump bid. The highest bidder wins the contract and must attempt to win the declared number of tricks.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>The Play</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game is played over a series of hands. The leading player plays a card, and the others must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play a card of the trump suit or any other card. The highest card of the suit led or the highest trump wins the trick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Joker is the highest trump unless No Trump is declared, in which case it is the highest card of any suit.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Scoring</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the bidding team wins the required number of tricks, they score points according to their bid. If they fail, they lose the same number of points. The non-bidding team scores points for any tricks they win.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game ends when a team reaches <span class="highlight">500 points</span>, or drops to <span class="highlight">-500 points</span>.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
                    <p>The first team to reach 500 points or force their opponents to drop to -500 points wins the game.</p>
